# runge_kutta

This code implements the classical four stage fourth order Runge Kutta method to solve an ODE system. 


calc_sRK4.m implements the classical four stage fourth order Runge Kutta method to solve an ODE system. After the calculation, it saves the workspace to a data file.


calc_sRK5.m implements the classical five stage fifth order Runge Kutta method to solve an ODE system. After the calculation, it saves the workspace to a data file.


f_sys.m calculates f_sys(w,t)


plot_sRK4.m reads in the data file generated by calc_sRK4.m. Then it plots the two components of the numerical solution: position and velocity.
